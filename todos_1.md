# Looking Back and Looking Forward

## Part 1: Refactor, Ya Hacker

Take one of the following assignments:

- Personal Website
- Mission to Mars Registration Form
- Clicker Game
- Blog

And refactor your code according to the best practices that we've been outlining- presentational versus stateful component structure, centralized state passing props, and accessible development practices using semantic HTML.

## Part 2: Thank U, Next (API Call)

Let's make a weather app. This app will tell the user what the weather will be like in NYC over the next five days. How you present this app is up to you, but one thing is non-negotiable: For your data, you have to make calls to the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev).

This API presents two new challenges to us:

- It utilized **Secret Key Authentication**. In other words, you have to register with them, at which point they'll display your Secret Key. You have to add your Secret Key into every API request in order to receive a relevant response.
  - **VERY IMPORTANT:** You Secret Key is not to be pushed to GitHub or any other public website!! Create a json file called `secret.json`, put your key in there, and then add that to your `.gitignore` file!
- It is _complicated_ in the structure of its responses. Take a look at a sample response:

A strong cold front and atmospheric river are forecast to bring periods of moderate to heavy rain to the San Francisco and Monterey Bay Area Wednesday into Wednesday night. This system is anticipated to interact with a plume of high total precipitable water (TPW) over the Pacific that will advect inland into California. Recent rainfall during the past several days and additional precipitation forecast through Tuesday night will increase soil saturation. This will likely increase the risk for rapid rises of creeks, streams and rivers across the region on Wednesday. Anticipate steady rain to develop over the North Bay around midday Wednesday and then spread steadily southward through the Bay Area during the afternoon and evening hours. The threat for urban and small stream/creek flooding will increase as rainfall rates may approach 0.75\"-1.00\" per hour at times ahead of and along the main frontal band. Additional rainfall amounts are forecast to range from 1.00\"-2.00\" in most urban areas and up to 2.50\" in the North Bay Valleys. Coastal ranges will likely see 3.00\"-6.00\" of rainfall from Wednesday into Wednesday night. Numerous showers will linger into Thursday morning in the moist post-frontal environment. Mainstem rivers, from the Russian and Napa Rivers in the North Bay to the Carmel and Big Sur Rivers farther south, are forecast to see significant and rapid rises Wednesday night into Thursday. Although present projections keep them within their banks throughout, they could well approach or even exceed monitor stage. Smaller rivers and streams could flood, especially if heavy rain rates persist across a particular watershed. Flooding would be most likely in the more typically flood prone low-lying areas. In addition, heavy rain rates over the North Bay burn scars could potentially trigger flash flooding or mudslide/debris flows. Away from the burn scars, shallow landsliding could also be a concern if precipitation rates and intensities are sufficient. Latest data from USGS research instrumentation in the San Francisco Bay Area indicates that shallow soils on steep hill slopes are approaching saturation. Drier conditions are expected Friday and Saturday with another chance of light rain Sunday followed by dry weather for MLK Monday. Persons living near rivers and streams or other flood prone areas should be alert for the possibility of flooding during this event. Please stay tuned to bulletins from NWS, NWS social media (@NWSBayArea), or from other sources of local weather information.\n","uri":"https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwacapget.php?x=CA125CE0A3AF30.HydrologicOutlook.125CE0B13100CA.MTRESFMTR.8cc97ea8069afd3c77676120abac4b73"},{"title":"Wind Advisory","regions":["East Bay Interior Valleys","North Bay Interior Valleys","San Francisco Bay Shoreline","Santa Clara Valley Including San Jose"],"severity":"advisory","time":1547672400,"expires":1547722800,"description":"...WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 1 PM WEDNESDAY TO 3 AM PST THURSDAY...
