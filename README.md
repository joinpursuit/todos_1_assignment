# Weather App

This weather app built with React shows the user what the weather will be like in a searched location over the next five days. 

The intuitive, simplified design was made in consideration for users who are interested in just a quick glance to receive the information they need about the weather. 

The app interacts with the Dark Sky API to get the weather data, and Map-quest Geolocation API to receive longitude and latitude properties of the user's search.

A toggle button quickly converts and displays the temperature between F and C. 

Async/await was used to handle the flow of the API requests.
